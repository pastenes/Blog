If you are a developer like myself, which you most likely are if you are reading this, you may have experienced what I call "Aha!" moments, which are those moments when you finally truly understand something that you are trying to learn, and it feels awesome! you know you will never forget it and the many ways you can apply this new knowledge comes rushing into your creative mind. And the best thing, it never gets old!

I can think of many of these moments throughout my career, since the freelancing days, internships and even recently.

Here are some of them:

## Classes? IDs?

Back in the day, It took me longer than I want to admit to wrap my head around CSS classes and IDs, then suddenly it hit me: Classes like, classes of cars (sedans, SUVs, wagons, etc), there are many of each class, and IDs like cars IDs, AKA license plates, there is only one car with any given license plate, plus, to refer a car by the license plate has more "weight" that referring to it by the type of car.

## Ternary operator

I learned this concept first on PHP. Then forgot about it, for years. A year or so ago I ran into it while doing a PHP refreshing course, but this time my creative mind saw more opportunities on how to use such a cool operator.

## JavaScript Objects

About half a decade ago I took an Object-Oriented Programming with Java. It was fun and confusing, mainly because at the time I didn't know how or when I would apply such skills. Reading the word "objects" in any JavaScript related documentation or course would make me freak out until I start learning the basics of JavaScript, especially the DOM or Document Object Model.

An object is just an organized list of stuff, with keys and values that can be nested. A web page is a collection of objects also known as a "Document". Boom, Aha! moment.

And you can do so many cool things with objects and JavaScript!

## Static sites generators

I've been a WordPress developer for more than half a decade. I can say many good things about this CMS, however, there is one huge downside that started to bother me a couple of years after starting developing in WordPress:

> Why any given page has to be "computed" by the server (PHP, Apache .& MySQL database) and generated (rendered) by the browser every single time it needs to be loaded?

it's not only a waste of server resources but a waste of every single user's time. On top of that, caching is a must with WordPress, but caching doesn't decrease the site's dozens if not hundreds of HTTP requests, and performance improvement is not improved by much.

I remember tinkering with plugins that would generate a plain HTML version of any WordPress site, but they had lots of bugs, understandable, considering that the plugin can't possibly accommodate compatibility for all themes and plugins out there.

The answer: statically generate the front end of a WordPress site using the REST API.

This Aha! the moment took a while, there were lots of trial and error, and thanks to that, today I'm a happy Gatsby/React developer.

More on this on a separated article.

## And many more

There are so many other examples that come to mind, especially the most recent ones, there are so many of them since I decided to do the move to the JavaScript world.

In this article, I just want to lay a foundation for what this blog will be. A log of things I've learned that excites me and is worth documenting here so my future me can refer to down the road, and why not, share it with anybody that finds it on Google.
